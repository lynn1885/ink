# Why build another editor
I just want to migrate my notes from Microsoft oneNote to this project, after using many rich text and markdown libraries like `quill`, `prosemirror`, `slate`, `stackedit`, `gitbook`, `marktext`(all of there are brilliant projects)... I found that I just want to build an editor that I can fully control it. this editor should have following features:
1. "markdown oriented"
2. easy
2. easy to control, easy to extend
3. running in a browser
4. WYSIWYG is better, but shouldn't pollute the markdown source code
finally I found that is easier to build such an editor based on `codemirror` instead of other markdown libraries.
This is just an idea, you can preview the effect here
